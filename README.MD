# Frequently Used Code Snippits

## How To Use This File

1. On the Developer tab of Excel you can import XML as a standard feature (schema file not necessary)

* this file is meant to work with the Proprietary AutoMacro Addin but can also just be used as general snippits to be copy/pasted into code modules for use

2. The code snippits are just meant to remove as much boiler plate as possible from initial code production and of some of the most common features that were not already present in AutoMacro
